You are tasked with developing an Employee Management System program in Java. The program will allow the user to input data for five employees and then display their details. Each employee is represented as an Employee object with attributes such as employeeId, employeeName, department, email, salary, and address.

Here are the requirements for the program:

Each Employee object should have the following attributes:

employeeId (a unique 5-digit number)
employeeName (2 to 30 letters long)
department
email
salary (a positive non-zero value)
address (between 5 and 100 characters)
The program should validate the input for each attribute according to the following rules:

employeeId should be unique and consist of exactly 5 digits.
employeeName should contain only letters and be between 2 and 30 characters long.
salary should be a positive non-zero value.
address should be between 5 and 100 characters long.
The program should prompt the user to input data for each employee. For each employee, the user should provide:

Employee ID (5-digit)
Employee Name
Department
Email
Salary
Address
After collecting the data for five employees, the program should display the details of all the employees, including their employeeId, employeeName, department, email, salary, and address.
